Are you curious about how psychological and biological factors, such as genetics and biochemistry, play a role in cognitive development? Do you want to investigate which factors contribute to the development of disorders such as autism or dyslexia? Are you interested in learning how to measure brain processes and use various diagnostic tools? Then the master’s specialisation in Developmental Psychology could be right for you. You’ll study the most recent developmental theories and research findings. And you’ll learn to apply various diagnostic and research tools in the clinical field and developmental research. This will make you well-prepared to work as a psychologist or researcher in mental health or educational institutions.
