Under which conditions does work stimulate human flourishing and when does it harm well-being and health? Which working conditions help prevent mental fatigue? What determines the effectiveness of a team? How do you stimulate innovation? And what are effective human resources practices? These are the types of questions you'll be asking if you specialise in Work and Organisational Psychology. The programme covers topics such as human resources, organisational behaviour and work psychology. You’ll also attend a series of workshops that specifically focus on practical skills, such as applying a job analysis or developing an occupational health intervention. After you’ve obtained your master’s, you’ll have all the preparation you need to become an organisational psychologist. But you could also pursue an academic career, studying the psychology of work and organisations. This master programme is offered by members of the Work and Organisational Psychology section.
