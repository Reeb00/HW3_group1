Our goal is to improve health by conducting world-class research and teaching in primary care.Our staff, both clinical and research-based, are dedicated to undertaking internationally acclaimed research and teaching that addresses problems posed by complex care needs and inequalities, particularly in relation to chronic illness and multimorbidity, and marginalised populations such as migrants and those living in areas of severe deprivation (e.g. the Scottish Deep End Project). We have a strong focus on anticipatory approaches to health and the implementation and integration of complex service innovations (e.g. digital health services, screening) along with an emphasis on the role of health policy in shaping the experiences of patients and professionals.
