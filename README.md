# HW3_group1

The main-notebook is called "main.ipynb".
Furthermore there are python-files to keep the main-notebook short and tidy.
- extract_masters.py to extract the attribute of each master
- general_functions.py for general functions like loading the dataset
- collecting_coords.py for the collection of coordinates needed for RQ 4
- map_visualisation.py for visualising the map desired in RQ 4


For the CLQ question we have add the file CommandLine.sh and the result are signed on the notebook.


The pretty view of our notebook can be found on:
